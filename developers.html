        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p>For my first data analysis project, I explored a dataset on customer purchasing behavior for an e-commerce website. <br> 
            Using Python and libraries like pandas and matplotlib, I cleaned the data, performed exploratory analysis, and <br>
            visualized key trends such as popular products and customer demographics. Through statistical analysis, I identified <br>
            correlations between different variables, such as purchase frequency and customer location. This project not only <br>
            helped me understand the data analysis process but also provided valuable insights into consumer behavior that could <br>
            inform marketing strategies for the company.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Project 2</h3>
        <p>For my second project, I tackled a problem-solving challenge using Python. Specifically, I developed a program to optimize delivery routes for a logistics company. <br>
             Leveraging algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm and greedy algorithms, I designed an efficient route planning system that minimized delivery time and cost. <br>
             The project involved parsing input data, implementing the algorithms, and validating results through simulations. By automating route optimization, the program <br>
              significantly improved operational efficiency for the company, demonstrating the practical application of problem-solving skills through Python programming.</p>
